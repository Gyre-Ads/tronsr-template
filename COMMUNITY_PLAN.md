µTorrent will continue to work hard to serve the community by improving its products with an emphasis on unifying the experience across desktop and mobile.  With the help of TRON, the company is exploring ways to leverage the TRON protocol to improve the speed of torrent swarms to make the BitTorrent protocol better.  As the success of these future projects depend on the TRON network, µTorrent has an invested interest in doing its part to reliably operate and manage the blockchain.  Doing its part as one of 26 Super Representatives, µTorrent will ensure it continues to meet the demands of millions of users while helping TRON lead the way for decentralized application development into the future.
