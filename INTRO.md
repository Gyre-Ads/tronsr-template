µTorrent is a torrent client that was originally created by Ludvig Strigeus (ludde), and is one of the most popular BitTorrent applications in the world.  In more technical terms, the client is a computer program that sits on the desktop and allows users to move data and large files over the internet quickly and efficiently.  µTorrent includes a suite of products available on Windows, Mac and Android, which are used by almost 100 million users worldwide.  The company recently introduced a new product, µTorrent Web, which delivers the next generation of torrenting through cutting edge simplicity in the download to play experience.  As µTorrent joins the TRON family and looks ahead, it does so with a combined vision of expanding decentralized internet values.  The company enthusiastically joins 26 other SRs in supporting the TRON ecosystem of decentralized apps and services of the future.
